# Artist_Emotions

What I'll be looking for in a painitng: an aritst convey emotions in Paintings:

1- colors
2- lines
3- shapes




Here's a list of colours commonly used to identify several emotions:

Red: Anger, embarrassment, passion, or love.
Blue: Shyness, sadness, or calmness.
Yellow: Cowardice, happiness, cheerful, or caution.
Green: Disgust, envy, ,greed,friendliness, soothing, calm, or safety
Purple: Pride, fear, or courage.
Grey: Depression, regular sadness, or stoicism.
Black: Coldness or mournfulness.
Pink: Cheeriness, embarrassment, or love.
White: Shock, fear, coldness, or mournfulness.
Orange: happiness and healthy
Purple: sadness, disgust, or mystery


Lines

A dark, thick, angled line can show anger or being mad
A thin, flowing, rounded line can show happiness


Shapes

Squares, triangles and rectangles can show anger, fear, confusion
Ovals can show sadness
Circles can show happiness and joy


Goals for the project:

- after extracting the dominant colors from all the photos, I will create a coloumn of the colors and the emotions accossiated with this color
- use one of the classifiers (knn for example) to predict the emotion from colors

- If the painting is a portrait, I can extract the facial expression by using the code I used in the 30 days of code

- perform NLP on the titles of the painting
