# Art&Emotions (Emotions Evoked from Colors of Paintings)

## Introduction & The Question
Artists often use color as a medium to convey different messages, feelings, and symbolisms. The artistsâ€™ use of different colors and shades can greatly influence how the viewer perceives a painting and what they take away from it. My Arts & Emotions project aims to provide a bridge between paintings and the emotions they evoke within us when we look at them. By explaining how different colors impact the human psyche I aim to help people understand why artists make the color choices they do and why as viewers we feel a certain way when looking at a painting




## Dataset
- WikiArt-info.tsv = original dataset before adding columns
- output.csv = csv file for the images url 
- full_emotion_color.csv = added columns to WikiArt-info.tsv 


## Data Dictionary 

<ul>
<li><i>ID</i>:    <i>Painting ID</i></li>
<li><i>Category</i>: <i>Painting style (Impressionism, realism, cubism .. etc)</i></li>
<li><i>Artist</i>: <i>The painting's artist's name</i></li>
<li><i>Title</i>: <i>The title of the Painting </i></li>
<li><i>Year</i>: <i>The year of the painting</i></li>
<li><i>Image URL</i>: <i>URL of the website that contains the image /i></li>
<li><i>Painting Info URLe </i>: <i>Info of the painting link</i></li>
<li><i>Artist Info URL</i>: <i>Info on the artist link </i></li>


</ul>
<br>

Added Columns 

- dcolor = dominant color in RGB format
- rgb = a palette of the colors used in the painting in RGB format
- palette = each of the color palettes names
- dcname =  the name of the dominant color

## Project approach & solution

My project works by putting images of paintings in color clusters and classifying them with emotions. Look below for more details.
I used kmean algorithm to cluster my images & knn classifier

## conclusion
to convey an emotion of a painting and for my model to be more accurate, I would need to analyze more factors such as the titles. This project is a working progress and I will be adding to it to make it more accurate.


## Future Development


<ul>
<li> Extract Emotions from Title & Painting Description using NLP </li>
  <li> Portrait & Landscape Paitings Classifier </li>
  <li> Extract emotion from face expressions in portrait paintings </li>
  <li> For the abstract/landscape paintings, I will analyze the lines & shapes</li>
</ul>
<br>

Lines: <br>
A dark, thick, angled line show anger or being mad <br>
A thin, flowing, rounded line show happiness


Shapes: <br>
Squares, triangles and rectangles can show anger, fear, confusion <br>
Ovals can show sadness <br>
Circles can show happiness and joy


## Limitations
My code was taking a long time to run when doing image processing
